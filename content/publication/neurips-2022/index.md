abstract: We present a model of a student-led community of researchers to highlight the impact of pursuing collaborative machine learning research on the groupâ€™s members individually as well as towards achieving shared goals. We provide concrete examples of the guiding principles that led to the evolution of the collaborative from a reading group into a research group and eventually launching a non-profit software product to help non-technical stakeholders leverage artificial intelligence (AI), improving access to advanced technologies, and promoting open science. Our goal is to lay out a template to launch similar small-scale collaborative organisations at different institutes around the world.
