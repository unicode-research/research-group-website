JournalismAI team [Parrot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15lq8gDr88mw3uw6AhN5oPPOMmX4D7UDE/view) comprising Ippen Digital (DE) and The Times / The Sunday Times (UK) partnered with SimPPL for studying the spread of potentially manipulated narratives on Twitter from two well-known Russian state-backed media outlets. The Parrot platform [demo](https://parrot.report/) with The Times (UK) was presented at the [JournalismAI Festival 2022](https://www.journalismaifestival.com/2022-fellows).
