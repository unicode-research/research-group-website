I am an undergraduate student at Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering with interests in Deep Learning, Federated Learning and Persuasive Technology. I have previously worked on various Deep learning projects like Research Paper Recommender System, Brain Tumor Segmentation, Anemia Detection. I have also been working on creating a framework to perform Federated Learning from scratch. I have recently started exploring Persuasive Technology.
