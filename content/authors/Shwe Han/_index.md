I graduated from The Ohio State University with Computer Science and Engineering specialized in Machine Learning. I am currently working as a software engineer at Bank of America in big data team where I write data ingestion flow and data preprocessing to train the models. I work on natural language processing and analytical projects outside of work. My previous and ongoing projects include topic modeling on news and financial text data set, sarcasm detection using neural nets modeling and training on social media dataset, unsupervised learning on patients history dataset, recommendation systems using reviews, sound/audio recognition, and housing market analysis.
