Swapneel Mehta is a Ph.D. student at NYU Data Science working with Richard Bonneau, Jonathan Nagler, and Joshua Tucker at the Center for Social Media and Politics with interests in simulation-based inference and causality. He uses probabilistic programming to conduct social network analysis, with a focus on understanding misinformation spread and control in a simulated training environment that he is developing. In the past, he has worked with recommender systems at Adobe Research, graph neural networks and particle physics at CERN, and Fortune 500 startups in cybersecurity and IoT. He mentors students doing research and software development as part of a student org. he co-founded, called Unicode.
