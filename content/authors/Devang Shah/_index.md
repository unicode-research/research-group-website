I am an enthusiastic B.Tech. Computer Engineering undergraduate student, working on Computer Vision, Object Detection & Classification, and Causal Inference. I have worked on projects using CV, Augmentations, Neural Networks, Regressions & Classifications. Currently, I am working on an algorithm to automate the interview scheduling process and trying to deep dive into 'Deep Learning'. I also have keen interest in Full Stack Web Development.
