I am a senior at DJSCE, interested in graph machine learning and socially responsible AI. As a Research Intern at IIT Patna, I am currently working on building models that can identify illicit activity in blockchain networks. I am also interested in the intersection of AI and psychology, and hope to work towards building systems that are safer and 'nicer'.
