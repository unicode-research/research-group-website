I have always had a passion for Mathematics. During my junior years, I was interested in Development, particularly Web and Android. Later on, I became fascinated with Machine Learning. Consequently, I completed a number of courses on Machine Learning (Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Deep Learning Specialization, Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models by Prof. Daphne Koller, Reinforcement Learning by Prof. David Silver, etc.). Currently, my primary interest lies in Software Development and using Machine Learning in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I have successfully completed multiple internships in both of these domains. I also love Data Structures and Algorithms and love participating in coding competitions. I regularly do competitive programming on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/fenil25/), Codechef and Hackerrank. Currently, rated 5 stars on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/fenil_25)
